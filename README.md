## Step 1: Data Collection

To begin the map-making process, I used GPS features within GoogleMaps to collect coordinate points of 6 Univerisity of Kentucky buildings (Lafferty hall, Appalachian Center, Patterson Office Tower, Erickson Hall, William T. Young Library, and the Gatton Student Center) with my iPhone XS. Being an anthropology graduate student as well, I wanted to see how accurate collected geographical coordinates from my phone would be to see if it would be reliable when conducting an excavation this summer. I chose these 6 buildings due to how much time I have spent in them this semester.

## Step 2: Input Into QGIS

After collecting the coordinate points, I input the latitudes as well as longitudes in Excel and then uploaded the file into QGIS. First, I hovered over the layer option within QGIS, clicked on "Add Layer," and then proceeded to click on "Add Delimited Text Layer."
